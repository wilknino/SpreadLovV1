I have a "Discover" page that includes a filter section allowing users to filter based on age, gender, and location. Currently, the filter is presented as a sidebar, but it is not functioning well and does not provide the best user experience. I would like the filter section to be implemented as a popup modal instead of the sidebar. When the filter icon is clicked, the filter should open in a clean, modern-looking popup. The popup should contain the following features:

Requirements:

Popup Design and Layout:

The filter should open in a centered popup, overlaying the page content.

The popup should be easily dismissible (using a close button or clicking outside the popup).

The design should be modern, clean, and user-friendly, with a smooth animation effect when opening and closing.

The popup should contain the following sections:

Age Range Filter: A slider allowing users to choose an age range (18-80 years).

Gender Preference Filter: A radio button selection (All Genders, Male, Female).

Location Filter (if applicable): Add an input field or select dropdown for location, depending on your system's needs.

Responsiveness:

The design should be fully responsive for all screen sizes, including mobile and desktop.

Ensure that the popup does not overflow on smaller screens and remains easy to interact with.

On mobile screens, ensure that the popup is touch-friendly and easy to close or adjust the filters.

UI Improvements:

The layout should have ample padding, clear borders, and well-defined sections.

Use modern UI components, such as material design buttons, sliders, and checkboxes.

Ensure the background behind the popup is slightly dimmed to focus attention on the filter options.

Functionality:

The popup should be opened only when the filter icon is clicked, and it should close when clicking on the close button or outside the popup.

Apply proper validations, such as ensuring all filters are clear when the user opens the filter again or resets the filter options.

Visual Enhancements:

The popup should have a smooth animation when opening and closing, making it feel modern and polished.

Use icons or labels where appropriate (e.g., for age and gender).

Ensure the popup is not overly large or small, balancing space for ease of use and a sleek design.
