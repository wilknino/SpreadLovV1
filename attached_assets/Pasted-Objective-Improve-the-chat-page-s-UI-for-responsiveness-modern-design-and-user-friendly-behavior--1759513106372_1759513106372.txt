Objective: Improve the chat page's UI for responsiveness, modern design, and user-friendly behavior. The goal is to make the page visually appealing, easily navigable on all screen sizes, and fix image display issues.

1. Modern and Clean Design:

Revamp the chat UI with a modern, minimalist approach. Use clean typography, sleek button designs, and subtle animations to enhance the user experience.

Use modern color schemes (e.g., soft, pastel, or neutral tones) to give the page a refreshing, contemporary look.

Add well-aligned elements, proper spacing, and rounded corners to buttons, input fields, and chat bubbles.

2. Make the Page Fully Responsive:

Ensure the page is responsive on all screen sizes, from mobile to large desktops, ensuring good usability across devices.

Use flexible grid layouts, CSS media queries, and auto-adjusting elements to ensure the content adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.

Optimize for both portrait and landscape orientations on mobile devices.

3. Improve Image Display:

Limit the size of images in the chat window to a fixed size (e.g., 200px by 200px or 300px by 300px) so that they don’t stretch across the screen, improving overall aesthetics and readability.

Ensure that images are displayed in a clean, uniform manner without affecting the layout (use CSS for fixed-width and height for images).

4. Improve Chat Input Box and Send Button:

Make the chat input box more interactive by adding placeholder text and ensuring the send button is clearly visible and easy to click/tap.

Add hover effects for buttons and input boxes for a more interactive feel.

Enable automatic resizing of the text input box when the user types, so it doesn’t feel cramped.

5. Fix Chat Bubble Alignment and Spacing:

Ensure chat bubbles are well-aligned (left and right messages should be clearly distinguishable, with different colors and spacing).

Add margin/padding to create clear separation between messages for a clean layout.

Messages should be aligned with proper spacing between each conversation thread.

6. Scrollbar Customization:

Add custom styled scrollbars to ensure they don’t feel out of place with the new design. Make them subtle and easy to use.

Ensure that scrollbars only appear when the content overflows the chat window and do not interfere with the design on small screens.

7. Enhance Performance:

Optimize the overall performance by minimizing the page load time, especially when handling images or files.

Implement lazy loading for images so that the page doesn’t become heavy, especially on slower internet connections.
